# UE5 Unreal Engine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my learning progress with **Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)**, focusing on creating a world scene, setting up characters, and recording a cinematic sequence as an **MP4 video**. The tutorial I followed provided step-by-step guidance on various aspects of Unreal Engine, helping me understand its tools and features comprehensively.

The final output is a **[cinematic animation MP4 file](https://youtu.be/zLjeUUv3TBc)**, showcasing the world and character I created within UE5.

## Tutorials Followed
The project is based on an Unreal Engine tutorial series by a knowledgeable content creator on **Bilibili**. Below is a summary of the main topics I learned during the course:

### **Topics Covered**
- **Basic Operations**: Understanding the Unreal Engine interface and tools.
- **World Creation**: Designing and enhancing a 3D environment using assets and post-processing techniques.
- **Player Creation**: Setting up character movement and controls.
- **Animations**: Applying animations to characters and integrating them into the scene.
- **Post-Processing**: Adjusting lighting, color grading, and effects to enhance the visual quality.
- **Sound and Effects**: Adding sound effects and visual effects to make the scene more immersive.
- **Cinematic Animation**: Creating and exporting a short cinematic sequence.
