# Unity Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project was created as part of an introductory **Virtual Reality Technology course** during my undergraduate studies in Software Engineering at **Northeastern University, China**. It represents my initial exploration of game development using **Unity** and **C# scripting**.

Though simple in scope, the project demonstrates fundamental concepts such as character control, UI design, and audio management.

## Features
### 1. Character Movement
- Implemented basic character controls using **C# scripts**, allowing the player to move forward, backward, left, and right.

### 2. Health Bar
- Designed and integrated a **health bar system** to visually represent the player's health status.

### 3. Audio Management
- Added background music with adjustable volume controls through the settings menu.

### 4. User Interface (UI)
- Created a **start menu** with a "Start Game" button and an **ESC-based logout option**, providing a basic user experience for navigation.

## How to Run the Project
1. Download the `Unity_Learning_Project.zip` file from the repository.
2. Extract the `.zip` file to a desired location.
3. Open the extracted folder and run the application file inside (e.g., `Unity_Learning_Project.exe` or similar, depending on the export settings).
4. The application will directly open to the game interface, where you can interact with the features described above.
5. Press the **Start** button to start the game.
6. Use the **W, A, S, D keys** to move the character.
7. Use the **ESC** to call for menu to adjust the music volume and exit the game. 

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Unity's **Scene Editor** and **Inspector Window** for designing and managing game objects.
- Writing **C# scripts** to control game mechanics.
- Integrating and managing **UI elements** and player interactions.
- Implementing basic **audio systems** in a game environment.

## Future Development
If expanded, the project could include:
- Enhanced character animations for more realistic movement.
- Enemy AI for creating challenges.
- Advanced game mechanics such as item collection or combat systems.
- More refined UI and additional menus (e.g., pause menu).

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed based on the guidance provided in the **Virtual Reality Technology course**. Special thanks to my instructor for introducing me to Unity and game development.

## Notes
This is a beginner-level project designed for learning purposes and does not represent a full game.
