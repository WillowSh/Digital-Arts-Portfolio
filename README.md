# Digital Arts Portfolio

Welcome to my Digital Arts Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of my projects related to digital arts, including computer graphics, animation, and simulation. I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Engineering, and after participating in the CSE 167 - Computer Graphics course during my international exchange at UCSD, I confirmed my passion for digital arts and decided to pursue graduate studies in this direction.

## About Me

- **Undergraduate Degree**: Software Engineering
- **Current Focus**: Digital Arts, Computer Graphics, Animation Production, and Game Development
- **Future Goals**: Pursuing graduate studies in Digital Arts, particularly in areas like computer graphics and animation.

During my time at UCSD, I was able to take hands-on courses and work on practical projects, which helped me to confirm my future direction in digital arts. The projects in this portfolio reflect my learning journey, demonstrating my ability to understand and apply various concepts in graphics, rendering, and simulation. These projects are primarily for learning purposes, and while they show my potential and enthusiasm, I plan to develop more advanced and complete works in the future.

## Projects Overview

This portfolio is divided into the following main categories:

### 1. C++ Graphics Rendering Project
This project involves creating a 3D rendering engine using C++. It is a part of my learning in computer graphics, and the focus is on implementing basic rendering techniques like transformations, projection, and shading. This is a learning project I completed as part of UCSD's CSE167 - Computer Graphics course. More details can be found in the `README.md` file within this folder.

### 2. Shadertoy Flocking Particle Simulation
A Shadertoy project showcasing the implementation of a flocking particle simulation. This project explores the interaction between particles and simulates realistic flocking behaviors. The project was done as part of my exploration of shader programming and GPU-based simulations.

### 3. Blender Works
This folder contains various Blender projects, which involve 3D modeling, animation, and rendering. The focus of these works is on understanding the principles of 3D graphics and digital animation. These projects were created using Blender as a tool for exploring digital art creation.

### 4. UE5 Project
This project is a personal initiative where I explored Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) for creating interactive environments and simple game mechanics. The goal was to get hands-on experience with UE5 and learn about game development, environment design, and real-time rendering.

### 5. Unity Project
This folder contains Unity-based projects where I focused on game development, including scene creation, interaction design, and basic gameplay mechanics. Unity was used as a tool to experiment with different approaches to game design and graphics programming.

## UCSD CSE167 - Computer Graphics Course

The majority of the projects in this portfolio, specifically **C++ Graphics Rendering Project**, **Shadertoy Flocking Particle Simulation**, and **Blender Works**, were completed as part of the CSE167 - Computer Graphics course at UCSD. This course covered fundamental topics in 3D graphics, including transformations, projection, shading, and animation.
